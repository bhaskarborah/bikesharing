Two additional visualizations which can be used for further analysis:
1. This analysis is done only on data from the month of August which is the most popular time to avail a bike service due to the pleasant weather. The analysis has to be done on other months to determine a more balanced approach to the economic benefits of the business.
2. This analysis does not take into account the feedback of the users, and what they find to be the pros and cons of the business. User feedback can form an important input to measure the success of the business.
